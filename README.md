Ezzi ("easy") is inspired by Interview Coder, designed to help developers succeed in technical interviews and beyond. This desktop application provides undetectable assistance for coding interviews, technical practice, and learning.

## What Ezzi helps with:

- **Technical interview preparation** - Practice and solve coding problems with AI guidance
- **Coding practice** - Solve LeetCode problems for fun and skill development  
- **Learning assistant** - Get hints and guidance when stuck, with full solutions available
- **Interview support** - Undetectable assistance during actual interviews, including screen sharing

## Why it matters:

- **Broken hiring process** - Job searches drag on too long, leading to burnout and declining confidence
- **Time constraints** - Sometimes you need to pass mandatory steps quickly without extensive preparation
- **Learning data structures** - Get guidance on where to start with each problem type
- **Language barriers** - Get hints in your native language to reduce cognitive load during interviews

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è **Screenshot capture and AI-powered analysis**
- üíª **Multi-language coding solutions** (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Swift, Kotlin, Ruby, SQL, R, PHP)
- üêõ **Debug mode** for solution improvement
- üëª **Always-on-top transparent window**
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Global keyboard shortcuts** for seamless operation
- üåê **Cross-platform support** (Windows, macOS, Linux* - development only, production use not recommended)
- üè† **Self-hosted deployment option**

## Roadmap

Here's what we're planning to develop for Ezzi:

### Interview Live ‚úÖ (Done)
A helpful tool that shows your problem, thoughts, and code all in one view. It works as an invisible layer during coding interviews.

### Hint-only üîÑ (Planned)
Gives you helpful tips on how to solve coding problems. Suggests which algorithms to use and helps identify problem types. Shows different solution approaches with their good and bad points. You can also see the complete solution if needed.

### Leetcode crusher üîÑ (Planned)
Helps you solve one coding problem at a time with a focus on finding the best solution. Keeps explanations simple and direct to save time.

### Quiz üîÑ (Planned)
Solve multiple choice questions that have time limits. Quickly.

### Take-home algo üîÑ (Planned)
Focuses on one coding task at a time and provides solutions without lengthy explanations. You can start with a simple solution and then learn how to improve it step by step.

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Download and build the latest release for your platform via git
2. Grant necessary permissions (screen recording on macOS)
3. Launch the application
4. Use global shortcuts to capture and analyze coding problems

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Quick access to all Ezzi features:

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `‚åò + B` | Hide/Show Window | Quickly toggle the visibility of the Ezzi window |
| `‚åò + H` | Take Screenshot | Capture the current screen to analyze code or problems |
| `‚åò + ‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí` | Move Window | Reposition the Ezzi window anywhere on screen |
| `‚åò + Return` | Generate Solution | Generate a solution for the current problem |
| `‚åò + Return` | Debug | Generate optimized solutions with performance improvements and detailed explanations of changes |
| `‚åò + G` | Reset Context | Clear the current conversation and start fresh |

### Configuration

The application supports various configuration options through environment variables:

- `VITE_SELF_HOSTED_MODE`: Enable self-hosted mode (bypasses authentication - you must host your own solutions server)
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Custom API server URL
- `PRODUCT_NAME`: Customize application name for builds

## Undetectability

Ezzi remains completely invisible during coding interviews across all major platforms.

### Works anywhere. Stays invisible.

From HackerRank to CoderPad, Ezzi runs in the background ‚Äî undetectable, seamless, and always on your side.

**Supported Platforms:** Zoom, HackerRank, CodeSignal, CoderPad, Amazon Chime, Microsoft Teams

### Core Undetectability Features

Four features that keep Ezzi completely invisible during your interviews:

- **Screen Sharing** - Invisible to all screen capture methods across Zoom, Teams, and web-based platforms
- **Active Tab Detection** - Keeps your cursor active and tab focused - no detectable switching occurs
- **Solution Explanations** - Provides code with inline comments and natural explanations for confident verbal reasoning
- **Webcam Monitoring** - Overlay positioning keeps your gaze naturally aligned with the coding area

### Platform Compatibility

Comprehensive testing across all major interview platforms and video conferencing software:

**Windows Support:**
- Zoom: ‚úÖ Fully invisible
- Microsoft Teams: ‚úÖ Fully invisible  
- Chime: ‚úÖ Fully invisible
- Web-based platforms (HackerRank, CoderPad, CodeSignal, TestGorilla, Google Meet): ‚úÖ Fully invisible

**Mac Support:**
- Zoom: ‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è Advanced capture with window filtering required
- Microsoft Teams: ‚úÖ Fully invisible
- Chime: ‚úÖ Fully invisible
- Web-based platforms (HackerRank, CoderPad, CodeSignal, TestGorilla, Google Meet): ‚úÖ Fully invisible

### Detection Tactics & How We Avoid Them

**Screen Sharing & Recording Detection**
Platforms capture your screen through various methods including native screen sharing, browser-based recording, and third-party capture tools.

**Our Solution:** Ezzi uses advanced rendering techniques to remain completely invisible to all screen capture methods across desktop and web platforms.

**Behavioral & Focus Monitoring**
Advanced platforms monitor tab switching, cursor idle time, eye movement patterns, and typing behavior to detect assistance.

**Our Solution:** Smart overlay positioning and cursor management maintain natural interview behavior. Toggle with ‚åò + B keeps focus active while repositioning with ‚åò + arrow keys aligns your gaze naturally.

**Verbal Explanation Requirements**
Interviewers expect detailed explanations of your thought process and implementation approach beyond just working code.

**Our Solution:** Solutions include comprehensive inline comments and natural explanations that help you confidently discuss your approach and reasoning.

**Proven Track Record**
Ezzi has maintained a 100% undetected rate across thousands of interviews on all major platforms including advanced monitoring systems.
